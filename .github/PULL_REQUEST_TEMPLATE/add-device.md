Adding support for a new device? This is the template for you.
Open your PR with:  ?template=add-device.md  appended to the compare URL,
or pick "add-device" from the template dropdown.

The model to copy: the DeathAdder V3 PR (#3). Adding a device is meant to be
a small diff — a DeviceSpec const, a line in SUPPORTED, a test, and a row in
docs/SUPPORTED-DEVICES.md; one code file total.
If your PR is bigger than that, something generic is missing from the crates;
flag it in the PR and we'll pull it up into the shared layer.

## Device

- **Model:** <!-- e.g. Razer DeathAdder V2 -->
- **USB id:** `VID 0x1532 / PID 0x____`
- **How I read the PID:** <!-- Device Manager / `Get-PnpDevice` / lsusb -->

## Protocol source

Snakecharmer's protocol knowledge comes from **OpenRazer**. State where each
fact below came from — ideally the OpenRazer source, otherwise a USB capture.

- [ ] Found the device in OpenRazer (`driver/razermouse_driver.c` / `razermouse_driver.h`), **or** captured its traffic with Wireshark + USBPcap and documented the reports.
- **transaction_id:** `0x__`  <!-- 0x3F on the Elite, 0x1F on the V3 — grep the DEATHADDER_* cases -->
- **Notes / quirks:** <!-- anything that isn't just "same as an existing device" -->

## `DeviceSpec` fields

Fill these in — they're the entire "crack", distilled:

| field | value | how you know |
|---|---|---|
| `product_id` | `0x____` | |
| `transaction_id` | `0x__` | |
| `rgb_zones` | e.g. `&[led::SCROLL_WHEEL, led::LOGO]`, or `&[]` for none | which lighting zones does the hardware have? |
| `dpi_buttons` | `Some(DpiButtons { up: 0x__, down: 0x__ })` / `None` | does it have wheel DPI buttons, and what vendor codes do they emit in driver mode? |
| `dpi_min` / `dpi_max` | `100` / `____` | the sensor's full range — **the UI must be actionable over all of it** |
| `polling` | `PollingSpec { protocol: Classic\|Extended, rates: &[...] }` | which command family (OpenRazer `razer_chroma_misc_set_polling_rate` vs `..._rate2`) and which Hz values the hardware accepts |
| `diagram` | `Diagram { width, height, shapes: &[...] }` | top-down button-map schematic as shape data, drawn using the model's official schematic or physical measurements. Copy the closest existing device's diagram and adjust — no artwork tools needed; the full workflow (drafting tips, the DSL, drawing recipe, verification) is [`docs/DRAWING-MICE-GUIDE.md`](../../docs/DRAWING-MICE-GUIDE.md). Shown in the settings window and rendered to `docs/assets/<device>.svg`. |

## Checklist

- [ ] Added a `DeviceSpec` const and registered it in `SUPPORTED` (`crates/razer-proto/src/lib.rs`).
- [ ] Added the device's row to `docs/SUPPORTED-DEVICES.md`.
- [ ] Regenerated the diagram SVG (`cargo test -p razer-proto -- --ignored regenerate_diagram_svgs`) and committed `docs/assets/<device>.svg`; the Button maps section embeds it and links the model's official schematic (no bundled PNGs, no trademarked logo).
- [ ] Added a per-device test (assert the transaction id and, if the range differs, the DPI bounds).
- [ ] `cargo test --workspace` is green.
- [ ] **No changes were needed** to `razer-hid` or the daemon. *(If you did have to touch them, say why here — it usually means a generic gap to lift into the shared layer, not device-specific code.)*
- [ ] Existing devices unaffected — the byte-exact report tests still pass unchanged.

## Hardware verification

Adding a device to the table is a claim about real hardware; back it up.

- [ ] Plugged the device in and ran the daemon; the log shows `Opened <model> (PID …, txn …; rgb=…, dpi_buttons=…)` with the expected values and **no crash-loop**.
- [ ] `charmctl set-dpi <n>` then `charmctl status` — DPI takes and reads back, including a value near the device's max.
- [ ] Feature flags behave: RGB works (or is correctly skipped), DPI-button remap works (or is correctly absent).

<!-- Paste the relevant daemon.log lines / charmctl output here. -->
